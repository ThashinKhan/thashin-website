                    <p><strong>HPS/FPGA Based MD5 Decryption SoC<inline class="inline-date">(May 2023)</inline></strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>DE1-SoC Dev Board was used to compute 32 MD5 hashes concurrently on an Altera Cyclone V FPGA. A custom MD5 hash controller application was created using a dual core ARM Cortex A9 based microcontroller running Yocto Linux.</li>
                        <li>Communication between the FPGA and processor was facilitated by the AMBA bus using the AMBA 3.0 (AXI V1.0) 32-bit protocol. Custom Avalon Memory Mapped (MM) Slaves were created using Altera's Qsys Integration Tool.</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <p><strong>Single Button Smart Phone Interface<inline class="inline-date">(April 2023)</inline></strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created a Smartphone Interface (SPI) which controls basic smartphone functions through a single physical button and a 24x2 LCD. By timing button presses, users can dial a number, call saved contacts, all while the SPI collects ECG data to be sent wirelessly via Bluetooth to an app.</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <p><strong>Media Center Embedded System<inline class="inline-date">(Nov 2022)</inline></strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created a media center on the NXP LPC1768 microcontroller.</li>
                        <li>Features included a photo gallery, audio player, and games.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Metropolitan Undergraduate Student Society: Equity Committee <inline class="inline-date">(May 2020)</inline></strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Raised awareness of issues facing students by creating a list of on campus resources which includes mental health and wellbeing, sexual violence and sexual support, and academic needs. The resource list is displayed on the MUES website.</li>
                        <li>Started the creation of an “Equality in Engineering” video showing off the diversity in Engineering, and the hardships that minorities face in the Engineering field.</li>

                    <p><strong>Capacitive Touch Bike Alarm<inline class="inline-date">(Dec 2021)</inline></strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Utilized capacitive touch in a bike lock to sound an alarm when unknown users interact with the lock. To deactivate the alarm, a combination must be entered, which was implemented using digital logic circuitry.</li>
                        <li>Additional design challenge was to keep the system cheap, and easy to make, which was accomplished by using an RC circuit along with an ATtiny85 microcontroller. Final BOM was less than $10, and designed in 3 days.</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <p><strong>Finite State Machine Dice<inline class="inline-date">(Nov 2020)</inline></strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created a pseudo randomized dice game utilizing the 7400-series TTL ICs.</li>
                        <li>Dice randomly outputs a state based on a custom-made finite state machine. Randomness was achieved by quickly switching states using a 555-timer circuit.</li>
                        <li>Created custom decoder which decoded the 3-bit FSM output into an LED dice-face representation. Symmetry was utilized to reduce the number of gates in the decoder.</li>
                        <li>PCB was designed in EAGLE for easy reproduction for use in board games.</li>
