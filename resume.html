        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p><strong>Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) & Reliability Intern - AMD, Markham, ON (May 2021 - Aug 2022)</strong><p>
        <ul>
            <li>Performed Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), and Safety pre-certification tests on various AMD GPUs.</li>
            <li>Verified AMDs GPUs comply with international standards for EMI/RFI (CISPR 32/FCC Part 15-B) and Safety (IEC62368-1 Ed 2).</li>
            <li>Mitigated EMI/RFI/Safety failures resulting from GPUs to ensure compliance with respective standards and first time pass at third-party certification. </li>
            <li>Assisted in 15+ EMC/Safety certifications in AMD Markham/third-party certification labs, and completed 125+ pre-certification tests on various AMD products. </li>
            <li>Experience with troubleshooting issues in Windows during systems setups by modifying vBIOS/IFWI, sBIOS, and Windows drivers. Debugged numerous issues brought up in Linux/Datacenter system setups, and with installation of AMD ROCm. </li>
            <li>Trained upcoming PEYs and wrote guides on various AMD tools, lab procedures and internal/external hardware and software to assist 3rd party sites and new students. </li>
            <li>Reduced EMI/Safety/RFI test overhead by modifying and creating excel templates using Excel VBA.</li>
        </ul>

        <!--School Projects-->
        <h2>School Projects</h2>
        <p><strong>HPS/FPGA Based MD5 Decryption SoC (May 2023)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>DE1-SoC Dev Board was used to compute 32 MD5 hashes concurrently on an Altera Cyclone V FPGA. A custom MD5 hash controller application was created using a dual core ARM Cortex A9 based microcontroller running Yocto Linux.</li>
            <li>Communication between the FPGA and processor was facilitated by the AMBA bus using the AMBA 3.0 (AXI V1.0) 32-bit protocol. Custom Avalon Memory Mapped (MM) Slaves were created using Altera's Qsys Integration Tool.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Single Button Smart Phone Interface (April 2023)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a Smartphone Interface (SPI) which controls basic smartphone functions through a single physical button and a 24x2 LCD. By timing button presses, users can dial a number, call saved contacts, all while the SPI collects ECG data to be sent wirelessly via Bluetooth to an app.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Media Center Embedded System (Nov 2022)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a media center on the NXP LPC1768 microcontroller.</li>
            <li>Features included a photo gallery, audio player, and games.</li>
        </ul>


        <!--Personal Projects-->
        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        <p><strong>Capacitive Touch Bike Alarm (Dec 2021)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilized capacitive touch in a bike lock to sound an alarm when unknown users interact with the lock. To deactivate the alarm, a combination must be entered, which was implemented using digital logic circuitry.</li>
            <li>Additional design challenge was to keep the system cheap, and easy to make, which was accomplished by using an RC circuit along with an ATtiny85 microcontroller. Final BOM was less than $10, and designed in 3 days.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Finite State Machine Dice (Nov 2020)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a pseudo randomized dice game utilizing the 7400-series TTL ICs.</li>
            <li>Dice randomly outputs a state based on a custom-made finite state machine. Randomness was achieved by quickly switching states using a 555-timer circuit.</li>
            <li>Created custom decoder which decoded the 3-bit FSM output into an LED dice-face representation. Symmetry was utilized to reduce the number of gates in the decoder.</li>
            <li>PCB was designed in EAGLE for easy reproduction for use in board games.</li>
        </ul>
