            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Thashin Khan and I'm an Electrical Engineering student from Toronto Metropolitan University.
                I recently completed a 16 month internship as an Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) & Reliability Intern at AMD.
                I have an interest in Embedded Systems and System on Chip (SoC) design, and below you'll find some highlighted projects 
                in these areas.  
                </p>

                    <h3>Single Button Smart Phone Interface</h3>
                    <a href = "./projects.html"> <img class = "SPI" src = "./img/SPI.png" alt="LCD displaying a number and a 3D printed button"> </a>
                    <p>The Smart Phone Interface (SPI) was created to aid people who suffer from limited finger and speech 
                        dexterity (Parkinsons, Multiple sclerosis, Paralysis, etc). By controlling the frequency and length 
                        of button actuations, SPI users can perform basic smartphone functionality such as dialing a number or 
                        calling a contact. The SPI also collects and sends ECG information via Bluetooth to a custom Android app. 
                        Wireless RF communication occurs between the LCD and button for a full wireless system. A custom UART 
                        communication protocol was created to facilitate wireless data transfer between the ATmega328P microcontrollers 
                        and smartphone.</p>

                    <h3>HPS/FPGA Based MD5 Decryption SoC</h3>

                    <p>A DE1-SoC Dev Board was used to calculate 32 MD5 hashes concurrently on an Altera Cyclone V FPGA. A custom MD5 
                        hash controller application was created using a dual core ARM Cortex A9 based microcontroller running Yocto 
                        Linux. Communication between the FPGA and processor was facilitated by the AMBA bus using the AMBA 3.0 (AXI V1.0) 
                        32-bit protocol. Custom Avalon Memory Mapped (MM) Slaves were created using Altera's Qsys Integration Tool.</p>

                    <h3>Finite State Machine Dice</h3>
                    <a href = "./projects.html"> <img class = "dice" src = "./img/dice.png" alt = "PCB for a FSM dice, and a 3D printed enclosure"> </a>
                    <p>Pseudo randomized dice game created using 7400-series TTL ICs. The dice face consists of LEDs connected to a 3-bit 
                        finite state machine which contains all 6 dice faces. By using a decoder, the state information was converted to a 
                        dice face on the LEDs. Randomness was achieved by quickly switching states using a 100KHz 555-timer circuit. A custom 
                        PCB was designed in EAGLE for easy reproduction and use in board games.</p>
