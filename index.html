            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Thashin Khan and I'm an Electrical Engineering student from Toronto Metropolitan University.
                I recently completed a 16 month internship as an Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) & Reliability Intern at AMD.
                I have an interest in Embedded Systems and System on Chip (SoC) design, however I am still learning everyday!  
                Below you'll find some highlighted projects in the areas that I am most interested in.</p>
